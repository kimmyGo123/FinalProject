    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p>I started this process by first creating the markup then moving to the css. I didn't like it, so I started over and did that again. The game idea? I have no idea how that happened. I pulled inspiration from Untitled Goose Game and Stardew Valley along with my dreams of making a game with a cow in it. This idea came from editing this documentation section enough until I was into the game I was describing.  <br>
    After making my initial CSS, I found a color scheme that I liked. I love the blues and yellows and believe it fits in with my images.  I made the cow and game scene image with Photoshop. I made sure to follow CRAP designs and my navigation lets the user know where they are and where they can go.  
     I connected the Spotify API with many issues with figuring out how to play the sound. I tried to use the Youtube API, but after some authentication errors, I decided to go with an embedded spotify playlist. 
    My main problem was time. I didn't have enough time due to dislocating my knee after slipping in the tunnels.   </p>
